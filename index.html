    <h1>Cedarpoint Dance</h1>
    <p>cedarpointdance(at)gmail.com</p>
    <p>
      Our purpose is to provide dance classes on Salt Spring Island for a variety of ages and levels.
      We are working on getting a dedicated studio space at the new CRD-run SIMS building starting in Summer 2022. 
      The goal is to provide a fully-equiped dance studio that is available for rent to local dance teachers to hold their classes. 
      Stay tuned as this unfolds!
    </p>
    <p>We are using the 'Royal We' here... Cedarpoint Dance is run by just me - Kathryn Luttin!</p>
