      <li>Class description: This class is for absolute beginners through to those with a couple years of ballet training. We’ll practice the basic movement patterns upon which ballet is built, and learn some simple combinations to get you moving. This class is intended to be inclusive of a diverse range of abilities and ages. You’ll be encouraged to do what works for your body at this time. Wear comfortable clothes that don’t restrict your movement. Ballet slippers are best, but socks work. The floor is not sprung, so we won’t be jumping. But we will have fun!</li>
